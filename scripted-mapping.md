# Fun with shapes: Scripted mapping in R or Python
**When:** Saturday, March 8, from 9 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 

**Where:** In room St. Croix I, a Mac lab on the sixth floor 

Let's face it, QGIS is the Excel of geospatial analysis. Sure, doing simple mapping in it and ArcGis is a blast, but executing complex, reproducible joins and measurements can be a real drag. Taking a more scripted approach is way less of a buzzkill, especially when you need to revisit your earlier work or share with others. Whether you choose R or Python, follow along from mapping basics to more complex techniques that will make your next geospatial analysis a walk in the park. Cut loose, write some replicable code and have fun with shapes!

**Prerequisites:** To get the most out of this session, you should have a working knowledge of both GIS/mapping techniques and some experience with either Python or R.

## The joys of APIs

Geo files are big and they can clog up your computer, use API instead!
